# 🌐 3-Tier Web Application Deployment on Azure with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to deploy a complete **3-tier web application** (Frontend, Backend, and MySQL Database) on **Azure**, using **GitHub Actions for CI/CD** and Azure App Services for cloud hosting.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Azure App Service (Linux)
- Azure MySQL Database
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Deployment Center (Azure Portal)
- GitHub Source Control

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend & Backend**: Deployed together using Azure App Service
- **Database**: Azure-hosted MySQL with custom schema (`myschema`)
- **Authentication**: Secure connection between App Service and DB
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions integrated through Deployment Center

---

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

1. **Create Resource Group** (Canada Central)
2. **Deploy App Service** with Linux OS
3. **Connect GitHub Repository** using Deployment Center
4. **Set up MySQL Server** and configure schema
5. **Configure Environment Variables** for DB connection
6. **Trigger Deployment** via GitHub Push → Azure Web App auto-updated
7. **Application Live**: Deployed website accessible via Azure URL
