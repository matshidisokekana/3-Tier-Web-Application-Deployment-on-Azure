# üåê 3-Tier Web Application Deployment on Azure with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to deploy a complete **3-tier web application** (Frontend, Backend, and MySQL Database) on **Azure**, using **GitHub Actions for CI/CD** and Azure App Services for cloud hosting.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Azure App Service (Linux)
- Azure MySQL Database
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Deployment Center (Azure Portal)
- GitHub Source Control

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **Frontend & Backend**: Deployed together using Azure App Service
- **Database**: Azure-hosted MySQL with custom schema (`myschema`)
- **Authentication**: Secure connection between App Service and DB
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions integrated through Deployment Center

---

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

1. **Create Resource Group** (Canada Central)
2. **Deploy App Service** with Linux OS
3. **Connect GitHub Repository** using Deployment Center
4. **Set up MySQL Server** and configure schema
5. **Configure Environment Variables** for DB connection
6. **Trigger Deployment** via GitHub Push ‚Üí Azure Web App auto-updated
7. **Application Live**: Deployed website accessible via Azure URL

### üí° Importance of CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)

* **Automation & Speed:** CI/CD automates the entire software delivery process ‚Äî from code commit to deployment ‚Äî which drastically reduces manual errors and accelerates release cycles. Instead of deploying manually, every change pushed to the GitHub repository is automatically tested, built, and deployed to Azure.

* **Improved Code Quality:** Continuous Integration ensures that code changes are regularly merged and tested, catching bugs or integration issues early before they reach production. This helps maintain a stable, reliable application.

* **Consistent Deployments:** Automated deployment pipelines guarantee that every deployment follows the exact same process, reducing environment inconsistencies and ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù problems.

* **Rapid Feedback:** Developers get immediate feedback on whether their changes successfully deployed or if any tests failed, enabling faster iterations and improvements.

* **Scalability:** CI/CD supports teams of any size and project complexity by standardizing workflows, making it easier to scale development efforts without slowing down delivery.

* **Business Agility:** Faster, reliable deployments mean new features, fixes, and updates reach users quickly, helping businesses respond promptly to market needs or issues.

### How CI/CD Added Value to This Project

* Integrated **GitHub Actions** with Azure Deployment Center to create a **seamless pipeline** that deploys the 3-tier web application automatically on every code change.
* Reduced manual intervention, saving time and minimizing human errors during deployment.
* Enabled continuous updates to the live web app with connected MySQL database, ensuring users always see the latest version.

### üåê Why Hosting a Website on Azure Cloud is Easy and Important

**Ease of Hosting on Azure:**

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Azure Portal provides an intuitive, web-based interface that lets you create and manage resources like web apps quickly‚Äîno deep infrastructure knowledge needed initially.
* **Managed Services:** Azure App Service handles the underlying infrastructure, OS patching, scaling, and availability, so you focus only on your app code.
* **Quick Deployment:** You can deploy websites directly from code repositories like GitHub, with built-in CI/CD support for fast, automated updates.
* **Built-In Security & Compliance:** Azure offers pre-configured security features and compliance certifications, helping protect your website and data without extra setup.
* **Scalability:** Easily scale your website up or down to handle changes in traffic, ensuring consistent performance without manual server management.

**Importance of Hosting Websites on Azure:**

* **Reliability & Uptime:** Azure‚Äôs global data centers and redundant infrastructure ensure your website is always available to users worldwide.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing helps optimize costs‚Äîyou only pay for the resources you use.
* **Global Reach:** With data centers around the world, you can deploy websites close to your users to reduce latency.
* **Integration with Other Services:** Azure websites can easily connect with databases, AI services, storage, and monitoring tools, enabling rich, modern applications.
* **Supports Modern DevOps:** Azure‚Äôs integration with GitHub, Azure DevOps, and other tools facilitates continuous deployment, testing, and monitoring workflows.
